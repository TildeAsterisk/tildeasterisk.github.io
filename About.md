# The Logogram
**~\*** is more than just a name. It's a symbol, a signature, a sigil.
The **tilde (~)** and **asterisk (\*)**, humble characters in the digital and linguistic worlds, come together to form the logogram **~\***. A symbolic fusion that reads as a full name: **Tilde Asterisk**. First name. Last name. Glyph and identity.
This logogram is the essence of my personal brand. It echoes ancient symbols like the **Chi Rho ☧**, an overlapping of Greek letters representing Christ, or alchemical marks whose meaning transcended language—emblems of ideas, forces, and personas. It’s shorthand for something larger, something mythic.
Think of **~*** as a digital sigil—part code, part poetry. A nod to the mystical in the mundane. Like **-Q** in Bond lore or **-X** in X-Men, it’s a signature that holds weight beyond its characters. It implies a presence, a persona, a creative force.
**Tilde Asterisk** is a pseudonym, but also a symbol. A reminder that even in a world of pixels and code, there’s still room for mystery.

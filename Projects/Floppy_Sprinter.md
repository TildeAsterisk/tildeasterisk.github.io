# üìù Developer Comments
Over the development of this game, I was able to develop the ideas, concepts and mechanics behind active ragdoll physics, simulation driven, procedural animation. Going on to develop the Physicanim ~* Unity Asset Package to help other game developers around the world to solve the problem of rigid body animated characters and their interactions with physics objects in the environment.
